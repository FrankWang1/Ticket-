# Ticket+

Ticket+ aims to use personalization to improve event search and recommendation based on visit history<br />
•	Researched common methods (User-based, Content-based, Demographic-based, Item-based etc.) to provide event recommendation based on item profile.<br />
•	Developed an interactive web page (HTML/javascript) for users to search events, update preference and view recommended events.<br />
•	Developed a web service using (Java servlet, REST API) to fetch event data from TicketMaster API.<br />
•	Utilized MySQL/MongoDB to store user preference and event information. <br />
•	Designed a content-based recommendation algorithm to match similar events based on categories.<br />
•	Improved precision of recommendation by ordering events based on distance, stars and matched categories<br />
•	Utilized ELK stack to monitor the geographic distribution of users<br />
•	Deployed to Amazon EC2 and tested with unit tests (JUnit) and load tests (JMeter) to handle 150 queries per second<br />
